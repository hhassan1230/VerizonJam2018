Load "Proton_Beam_FX.unity" for an example scene, or simply drag Proton_Beam.prefab from the Prefabs folder (in the Project window) into the Hierarchy window. Note there's also a reduced particles Prefab for a reduced performance impact.

Hold down the left mouse button to fire the proton gun and release to stop.

Have fun!
